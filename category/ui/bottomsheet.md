One way to present a set of actions to a user is with bottom sheets, a sheet of paper that slides up from the bottom edge of the screen. Bottom sheets offer flexibility in the display of clear and simple actions that do not need explanation.

> Note: Google introduced official bottomsheets implementation in Support library 23.2.0,thus this library is no longer activly being developed. I will continuely fix defects been found and accept good PR but No more new feature will be developed. Thanks for your support!
